title: Lysosomal genes in neurological tumors: omics analysis

description: |
  This project aims:
  * To characterize variants in genes that encode lysosomal enzymes in different types of cancer deposited in the TCGA - The Cancer Genome Atlas.
  * To identify SNP's in genes that encode lysosomal enzymes and in the main genes involved in autophagy processes in different types of tumor subgroups;
  * To investigate possible variations in the number of copies (CNVâ€™s) in genes that encode the different lysosomal hydrolases;
  * To estimate the functional impact of variants found from in silico predictors;
  * To compare the frequency of these changes in TCGA patients with population databases, such as gnomAD and AbraOM, and other genomic databases.
